a tool for downloading the Gulflink library from the Office of the Secretary of Defense


The Office of the Secretary of Defense, OSD, maintains a resource, GulfLINK, of many documents surrounding the first Gulf War.  The purpose of this resource is to provide information relavent to the health of those involved.  The full GulfLINK site is here: http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/

GulfLINK also contains declassified intellegence reporting.  This makes it a valuable Unclassified testing resource for those working with that type of data.

Apparently, there has been some maintainence of the site.  Browsing should begin rooted at: http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/library/declas/declas_browse.jsp
