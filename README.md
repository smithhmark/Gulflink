Gulflink
========

a tool for downloading the Gulflink library from the Office of the Secretary of Defense

## Overview

The Office of the Secretary of Defense, OSD, maintains a resource, GulfLINK, of many documents surrounding the first Gulf War.  The purpose of this resource is to provide information relavent to the health of those involved.  

The original full GulfLINK site ( http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/) has been replaced.

The new Gulflink site: https://gulflink.health.mil/ respects that the DOD decided to reclassify the intelligence reporting previously reported to Gulflink. Therefore, use of the wayback machine is necessary to get the data. Sadly, the imagefiles associated with the OCR'd text are not available via the archive that that information is lost to my knowledge. Here is an example linke to the Library in the archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20050215165807/http://gulflink.osd.mil:80/declassdocs/dia/19970613/

GulfLINK also contains declassified intellegence reporting.  This makes it a valuable Unclassified testing resource for those working with that type of data.

Apparently, there has been some maintainence of the site.  Browsing should begin rooted at: http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/library/declas/declas_browse.jsp
